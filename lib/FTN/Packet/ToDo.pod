=head1 FTN::Packet ToDo

=head2 General

As the packet file specification was originated on x86 systems, which are
little endian, problems come up with reading/writing such files on big-endian
systems. Use the explicit < (little endian) modifer for the pack/unpack
functions?  Or change which format codes are being used? Reference also the
Byte-order-modifiers section in perlpacktut.

Use the same key names for the message hash for in the read and write packet
functions, so as to avoid confusion; match them up as necessary to the names
of the fields in the ftsc document.

The $Origin, $seen_by, & $Path variables at Lines 322-324 in the write_ftn_packet
function of Packet.pm. Should that creation of an origin line really be in the
packet file creation? Or is that something that should be getting created in the
message body and getting passed that way?  It also hard codes "1" as the origin
point number, when that should be OrgPoint. Same for the $seen_by and $Path
variables; they are part of the messages, but shouldn't they already be in
the message bodies being passed to the write_ftn_packet function?

Fix the possible ftsc date related issues in the course of creating and
using an ftsc_date function.

Add a separate function for reading a packet header when passed the name and
path of an FTN packet file. Also add other functions as necessary: like one for
generating a serial number, one for generating a name for a standard packet
file, one for generating an ftsc standard date.

Clean up indentation/whitespace in README.

In order to provide Object Oriented functions for writing an FTN Packet,
start with a merge of FTN::Pkt into FTN::Packet.


=head2 write_ftn_packet()

Areas & Tearline hash references should be in the packet_info hash or
a message hash?  Certainly there is an area field included in the msg
hash being returned by the read_ftn_packet.

When doing, for instance, two messages: two messages were making it into the
packets but they're both the text of the second message. The "foreach" line
at 354 does appear to work (instead of the two commented out versions of
initiating a loop at 355-356) because two messages are being put into the
packet file, but the message body does not appear to be makeing it in. (Do
the two commented out lines after that need to be kept?)  The line at 354
should be bringing the Body of the message in; no apparent error when
running a test script but is that line correct?

Also the serial number for the MSGID is coming up as the same for both
messages. When code a better way of getting a 8 char serial number to use,
add it as a function to the module?

The writeup and variable usages for the packet format per FTS-0001 could
be rewritten to more closely match the current documentation, esp. the
listed order.

Change the name of the appropriate fields in the packet related hashes to
being named after how they are named in the FTS-0001 documentation.


=head2 read_ftn_packet()

A second tear line of just "---" is showing up in the body of a message.

A period is showing up at the end of the ftscdate variable; is that actually
how the ftscdate is in the packet or is that an artifact of the code?

Change the name of the appropriate fields in the packet related hashes to
being named after how they are named in the fts-0001 documentation.

The zone number information is not being pulled from what is available in the
packet; needed to set the from_node & to_node variables instead of assuming
zone 1. It is in the packet header but is not being read in the current code,
so at least that part of the packet header needs to be read.  Once the
separate function to get packet header information is available, will just
be able to use that.

Make the message Reply IDs availabe in the same way as the Msg IDs?  (Are they
in use?)

Provide the message control info as a hash?

Is the name read_ftn_packet too generic for what it actually does, which is only
to read messages from an FTN packet file? Perhaps read_packet_messages? (Could
then have a similar function named read_packet_header.) Or read_ftn_messages?


=head2 Test Scripts

Can or should something else be used for testing the correct number of messages
in a packet besides is_deeply()?
