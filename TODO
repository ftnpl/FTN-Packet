To do:  FTN:Packet

    write_ftn_packet()
- When doing, for instance, two messages:  the two messages are making it into
the packets but they're both the text of the second message.
- Also the serial number for the MSGID is coming up as the same for both.  When
code a better way of getting a 8 char serial number to use, add it as a function
to the module?

    read_ftn_packet()
- Change the name of the appropriate fields in the packet related hashes to being
named after how they are named in the fts-0001 documentation.
