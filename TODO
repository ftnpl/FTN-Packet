To do:  FTN:Packet

    writepkt()
- When doing, for instance, two messages:  the two messages are making it into
the packets but they're both the text of the second message.
- Also the serial number for the MSGID is coming up as the same for both.  When
code a better way of getting a 8 char serial number to use, add it as a function
to the module?
